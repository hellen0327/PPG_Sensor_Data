# PPG and Glucose Dataset

## 📌 Description  
This repository contains a dataset of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals recorded from three different locations (forehead, ear, and fingertip), along with patient metadata including age, gender, and blood glucose levels. The dataset is intended for research in biomedical signal processing, machine learning applications, and physiological monitoring.  

## 📊 Dataset Structure  
The dataset consists of processed `.CSV` files containing PPG signals and corresponding patient metadata. Each file corresponds to an individual recording session. Additionally, `.TXT` files provide metadata summaries for each subject.  

## 📁 Data Format  
Each `.CSV` file contains:  
- **Time (s):** Timestamp of the recording.  
- **PPG_Forehead:** PPG signal recorded from the forehead.  
- **PPG_Ear:** PPG signal recorded from the ear.  
- **PPG_Fingertip:** PPG signal recorded from the fingertip.  
- **Age:** Subject's age.  
- **Gender:** Subject's gender (`M` for male, `F` for female).  
- **Glucose Level (mg/dL):** Blood glucose measurement at the time of the recording.
